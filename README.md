# spectrum_plotter
A Python package for creating standard plots for neutron / photon / particle spectrum

# Installation

```bash
pip install spectrum_plotter
```

# Usage

There are two main functions for plotting spectrum:

```plot_spectrum_from_values()``` - allows users to pass in the tally via a dictionary of numpy arrays.

```plot_spectrum_from_tally()``` - allows users to pass in an OpenMC tally and plot the result. OpenMC is therefore required for this approach
